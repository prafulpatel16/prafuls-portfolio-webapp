## Introduction
This project demonstrates how to build a serverless web application with a Resume Download Functionality and Visitor Counter using AWS services. The primary focus is on leveraging API Gateway, Lambda Functions, S3, DynamoDB, and IAM roles. This system ensures that the infrastructure operates efficiently within the AWS Free Tier limits and maintains a budget of $10/month for all AWS resources.

- **GitHub**: Project hosting and collaboration platform.

### Scripting
- **Python**: Language for Lambda functions handling resume downloads and visitor counter logic.
- **Boto3**: AWS SDK for Python, used to interact with AWS services (S3, DynamoDB).

### Deployment & Hosting
- **AWS Free Tier**: Ensures usage remains within the AWS Free Tier limits by optimizing Lambda, API Gateway, S3, and DynamoDB usage.

## System Design Overview
The architecture is designed to provide serverless, scalable, and cost-effective functionality. It uses Lambda for backend logic, API Gateway to expose endpoints, and DynamoDB for storage.

## System Architecture

-  The architecture consists of:

-  Frontend: A simple HTML/Bootstrap-based web page hosted via a static site generator (e.g., AWS S3 or EC2).

-  Backend Services: Lambda functions that handle:

-  Resume Download: Fetching the resume from an S3 bucket and allowing the user to download it.

-  Visitor Counter: Logging visits in a DynamoDB table and returning the visitor count.

## Core AWS Services Used:

- S3: Stores the resume PDF.

- Lambda: Handles the backend logic (fetching the resume and tracking visitor count).

- API Gateway: Exposes API endpoints for Lambda functions.

- DynamoDB: Stores visitor count.

- IAM Roles: Manages access permissions.


## Infrastructure Setup

### IAM Role Setup
1. Create an IAM role for Lambda functions with permissions for:
   - S3 (for resume storage)
   - DynamoDB (for visitor counter)
   - AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess: Allows Lambda to read from the S3 bucket.

   - AmazonDynamoDBFullAccess: Allows Lambda to interact with DynamoDB.

   - AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole: Grants Lambda access to CloudWatch for logs.

2. Attach policies for specific actions on the S3 bucket and DynamoDB table.

### Lambda Function Setup
1. **Resume Download Function**: Allows users to download the resume PDF from S3.
2. **Visitor Counter Function**: Increments a visitor count in DynamoDB and retrieves the updated count.

### API Gateway Setup
1. Configure REST API endpoints for both Lambda functions.
2. Set up integrations with Lambda functions, using path-based routing for `resume/download` and `visitor/count`.

## Resume Download Functionality

### Implementation Overview
This functionality enables users to download the resume PDF from an S3 bucket via an API Gateway endpoint.

### S3 bucket Configuration to store the resume pdf files
1. Create an S3 bucket to store the resume file.
2. Upload the resume PDF with appropriate permissions for Lambda access.

### S3 bucket to upload a code and host a static webapp

### Lambda Function Setup
- Steps to Create Lambda Function for Resume Download:

- Create Lambda Function:

- Go to AWS Lambda and click "Create Function."

- Choose the "Author from scratch" option.

- ame the function ResumeDownloadFunction.

- Choose the runtime (Python 3.9 or Node.js as per your choice).

- Set the IAM role to the one you created (Lambda-Resume-Download-Role).

# Lambda Function: Resume Download Handler

This Lambda function downloads a resume PDF from an S3 bucket and returns it as a binary stream for download.
- Set Environment Variables:

- S3_BUCKET_NAME: Your S3 bucket name.

- RESUME_KEY: The key (path) to your resume PDF file in S3.

- Steps to Create Lambda Function for Visitor Counter:

### API Gateway-Lambda Integration for Resume Download
1. Set up an API Gateway endpoint `/resume/download`.
2. Integrate this endpoint with the Lambda function responsible for fetching the resume file from S3.

## Visitor Counter Functionality
![alt text](images/APIgt-1.png)


### Implementation Overview
This feature tracks the number of visitors to the site by incrementing a count stored in DynamoDB.

### DynamoDB Configuration
1. Create a DynamoDB table with a primary key for storing the visitor count.
2. Use an `UpdateItem` operation in the Lambda function to increment the count on each visit.

- Create a DynamoDB Table:

- Go to DynamoDB in the AWS Console.

- Create a table called VisitorCounter.

- Set id as the partition key.

- Prepopulate the table with an item:

### API Gateway-Lambda Integration for Visitor Counter
1. Set up an API Gateway endpoint `/visitor/count`.
2. Integrate this endpoint with the Lambda function that updates and retrieves the visitor count.

## Security Measures
1. **IAM Roles**: Grant limited permissions to Lambda functions.
2. **API Gateway Authorization**: Set up authorization if needed for additional security.
3. **CloudWatch Monitoring**: Track Lambda execution logs, errors, and metrics.
4. **AWS WAF (Optional)**: Apply a Web Application Firewall to API Gateway endpoints for added protection against web-based attacks.

## Budget Considerations
- By leveraging the **AWS Free Tier**, costs can be minimized with free usage allowances for Lambda, API Gateway, S3, and DynamoDB.
- Monitor AWS usage to ensure operations remain within free-tier limits.

## Deployment Diagram
Here is an overview of the architecture deployment:

- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript on S3 and CloudFront (for caching).
- **API Gateway**: Connects frontend with backend Lambda functions.
- **Lambda Functions**: Handles backend logic.
- **DynamoDB**: Stores visitor count.
- **S3**: Stores resume files.

## Final Testing & Validation
1. Test the resume download functionality by hitting the `/resume/download` endpoint.

2. Test the visitor counter functionality by hitting the `/visitor/count` endpoint.

![alt text](images/web9.png)

3. Monitor CloudWatch logs for any errors or performance issues.

The /visitCount endpoint calls the Lambda function, which increments and returns the updated visitor count.
