## System Design Overview
The architecture is designed to provide serverless, scalable, and cost-effective functionality. It uses Lambda for backend logic, API Gateway to expose endpoints, and DynamoDB for storage.

## System Architecture

-  The architecture consists of:

-  Frontend: A simple HTML/Bootstrap-based web page hosted via a static site generator (e.g., AWS S3 or EC2).

-  Backend Services: Lambda functions that handle:

-  Resume Download: Fetching the resume from an S3 bucket and allowing the user to download it.

-  Visitor Counter: Logging visits in a DynamoDB table and returning the visitor count.

## Core AWS Services Used:

- S3: Stores the resume PDF.

- Lambda: Handles the backend logic (fetching the resume and tracking visitor count).

- API Gateway: Exposes API endpoints for Lambda functions.

- DynamoDB: Stores visitor count.

- IAM Roles: Manages access permissions.


## Infrastructure Setup

### IAM Role Setup
1. Create an IAM role for Lambda functions with permissions for:
   - S3 (for resume storage)
   - DynamoDB (for visitor counter)
   - AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess: Allows Lambda to read from the S3 bucket.

   - AmazonDynamoDBFullAccess: Allows Lambda to interact with DynamoDB.

   - AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole: Grants Lambda access to CloudWatch for logs.

2. Attach policies for specific actions on the S3 bucket and DynamoDB table.

### Lambda Function Setup
1. **Resume Download Function**: Allows users to download the resume PDF from S3.
2. **Visitor Counter Function**: Increments a visitor count in DynamoDB and retrieves the updated count.

### API Gateway Setup
1. Configure REST API endpoints for both Lambda functions.
2. Set up integrations with Lambda functions, using path-based routing for `resume/download` and `visitor/count`.

## Resume Download Functionality

### Implementation Overview
This functionality enables users to download the resume PDF from an S3 bucket via an API Gateway endpoint.

### S3 bucket Configuration to store the resume pdf files
1. Create an S3 bucket to store the resume file.
2. Upload the resume PDF with appropriate permissions for Lambda access.

### Lambda Function Setup
- Steps to Create Lambda Function for Resume Download:

- Create Lambda Function:

- Go to AWS Lambda and click "Create Function."

- Choose the "Author from scratch" option.

- ame the function ResumeDownloadFunction.

- Choose the runtime (Python 3.9 or Node.js as per your choice).

- Set the IAM role to the one you created (Lambda-Resume-Download-Role).

# Lambda Function: Resume Download Handler

This Lambda function downloads a resume PDF from an S3 bucket and returns it as a binary stream for download.
- Set Environment Variables:

- S3_BUCKET_NAME: Your S3 bucket name.

- RESUME_KEY: The key (path) to your resume PDF file in S3.

![alt text](images/lambda-2.png)

- Steps to Create Lambda Function for Visitor Counter:

### API Gateway-Lambda Integration for Resume Download
1. Set up an API Gateway endpoint `/resume/download`.
2. Integrate this endpoint with the Lambda function responsible for fetching the resume file from S3.

## Visitor Counter Functionality
![alt text](images/APIgt-1.png)


### Implementation Overview
This feature tracks the number of visitors to the site by incrementing a count stored in DynamoDB.

### DynamoDB Configuration
1. Create a DynamoDB table with a primary key for storing the visitor count.
2. Use an `UpdateItem` operation in the Lambda function to increment the count on each visit.

- Create a DynamoDB Table:

- Go to DynamoDB in the AWS Console.

- Create a table called VisitorCounter.

- Set id as the partition key.

- Prepopulate the table with an item:

![alt text](images/dyndb-2.png)

### API Gateway-Lambda Integration for Visitor Counter
1. Set up an API Gateway endpoint `/visitor/count`.
2. Integrate this endpoint with the Lambda function that updates and retrieves the visitor count.

## Security Measures
1. **IAM Roles**: Grant limited permissions to Lambda functions.
2. **API Gateway Authorization**: Set up authorization if needed for additional security.
3. **CloudWatch Monitoring**: Track Lambda execution logs, errors, and metrics.
4. **AWS WAF (Optional)**: Apply a Web Application Firewall to API Gateway endpoints for added protection against web-based attacks.

## Budget Considerations
- By leveraging the **AWS Free Tier**, costs can be minimized with free usage allowances for Lambda, API Gateway, S3, and DynamoDB.
- Monitor AWS usage to ensure operations remain within free-tier limits.

## Deployment Diagram
Here is an overview of the architecture deployment:

- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript on S3 and CloudFront (for caching).
- **API Gateway**: Connects frontend with backend Lambda functions.
- **Lambda Functions**: Handles backend logic.
- **DynamoDB**: Stores visitor count.
- **S3**: Stores resume files.

## Final Testing & Validation
1. Test the resume download functionality by hitting the `/resume/download` endpoint.

![alt text](images/tf1.png)


Updated Terraform Code (If Private Access is Needed)
If you do not need public access, modify the s3_static_website/main.tf to remove the aws_s3_bucket_acl and aws_s3_bucket_policy resources:

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "website_bucket" {
  bucket = var.website_bucket
  acl    = "private"   # Ensure the ACL is private
  # Remove the `aws_s3_bucket_acl` and `aws_s3_bucket_policy` blocks
}

# Project Structure

![alt text](images/sam1.png)


## Key Components:
- visitorCounter/: Lambda function to track and return visitor counts.
- resumeDownload/: Lambda function to allow resume downloads.
- static-site/: Static website content for hosting.
- template.yaml: SAM template to define resources and infrastructure.
- Makefile: Simplifies build, deploy, and static upload tasks.


# Step 1: Configure the SAM Template
  The template.yaml defines all the resources:

- S3 buckets for static web hosting and resume storage.
- Lambda functions for visitor count and resume download.
- DynamoDB table for visitor data.
- API Gateway for routing requests.
- Ensure the following configurations are correct:

- Bucket names use !Sub "${AWS::StackName}-[bucket-name]".
- Lambda environment variables like DYNAMODB_TABLE_NAME and RESUME_BUCKET_NAME.


# Step 2: Install Dependencies
Navigate to each Lambda function directory (visitorCounter and resumeDownload) and create a requirements.txt file with the required Python libraries.


- For example: visitorCounter/requirements.txt:

boto3


- Run the following commands to install dependencies:

pip install -r visitorCounter/requirements.txt -t visitorCounter/
pip install -r resumeDownload/requirements.txt -t resumeDownload/

# Step 3: Build the SAM Application
To build the SAM application, run:

sam build


What Happens During sam build?
The SAM CLI packages dependencies for the Lambda functions.
The build artifacts are stored in the .aws-sam/build/ directory.

# Step 4: Deploy the Application
Run the following command to deploy the application:

sam deploy --guided

### Key Deployment Prompts:
- Stack Name: Enter the CloudFormation stack name (e.g., prafuls-webapp).
- AWS Region: Specify the region (e.g., us-east-1).
- Allow SAM CLI IAM Role Creation: Choose y to allow.
- Save Arguments to Config File: Choose y to save to samconfig.toml.
- The deployment process:

Packages the application.
Uploads it to an S3 bucket managed by SAM.
Deploys the stack using CloudFormation.


# Step 5: Upload Static Web Content

After deploying the application, retrieve the S3 bucket name for static content:


aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name prafuls-webapp --query "Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey=='StaticWebsiteBucketName'].OutputValue" --output text

- Use the bucket name to upload the static site:

aws s3 sync static-site/ s3://[Bucket-Name]


# Step 6: Verify the Deployment

Check the CloudFormation outputs to get the URLs:

aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name prafuls-webapp --query "Stacks[0].Outputs"

Key Outputs:

StaticSiteURL: URL for the hosted website.
VisitorCounterApiURL: Endpoint for visitor counter API.
ResumeDownloadApiURL: Endpoint for resume download API.


# Step 7: Automate with Makefile


Use the provided Makefile to automate the process:


S3_BUCKET=$(shell aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name prafuls-webapp --query "Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey=='StaticWebsiteBucketName'].OutputValue" --output text)
BUILD_DIR=static-site

.PHONY: build deploy upload-static

build:
	sam build

deploy: build
	sam deploy

upload-static:
	@if [ -z "$(S3_BUCKET)" ]; then \
		echo "Error: S3_BUCKET is not set."; \
		exit 1; \
	fi
	aws s3 sync $(BUILD_DIR) s3://$(S3_BUCKET) --delete



Run the following commands:

1. Build
make build

![alt text](images/make1.png)
![alt text](images/make2.png)

2. Deploy 
make deploy
![alt text](images/make3.png)

3. Upload Static content
make upload-static


### Troubleshooting
- Permission Issues: Ensure the IAM user or role has the necessary permissions for S3, Lambda, and CloudFormation.

- AccessControlListNotSupported Error: Remove --acl public-read and use bucket policies for public access.

- Python Errors: Ensure python3.8 is installed and available in the PATH.


Bucket Policy:
aws s3api put-public-access-block \
    --bucket prafuls-webapp-s3staticwebapp \
    --public-access-block-configuration BlockPublicAcls=false,IgnorePublicAcls=false,BlockPublicPolicy=false,RestrictPublicBuckets=false
